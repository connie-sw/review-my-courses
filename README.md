##### This is for UW CSS students to get more information about courses. During my undergraduate years, I had a lot of worries and concerns about what classes to take, as I always felt there was not much information about the course details.
##### The functions of this website are: add reviews (like course name, quarter/year taken, professor, and overall details or review), search review by the course name, edit/delete reviews, and contact to the developer (in this case, contact to me for any feedbacks)
##### I was in charge of front-end and deploy; the technology I used are: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Node.JS, EJS, Git, Mongoos, Mongo DB, Mongo DB Atlas, and Heroku.
###### !! CSS 498 is a UWB CSS course for independent study.<br/>!! This project is using passport API for login system but it's not stable when multi users are accessing to it. It has to be improved.
